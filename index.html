        <p>Training to improve your body, mind, and wellbeing is not difficult.

          It is simple, and only requires consistency, sprinkled with a bit of effort.</p>

        <p><i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> The best gym I have been to in 30 years. Why? The owner Matt and his team
          have created a unique atmosphere and ethos. All ages and abilities are welcome. There's abundant equipment for
          most types of training with the emphasis on positive health engaging weight training. Matt had great expertise
          in all aspects of training, physical and mental. I have seen people in their 60s and their 70s get stronger,
          fitter and happier. Don't take my word for it. Try it for 6 months and see where you get to. <i
            class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></p>
        <p><i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> Joined Prime about a month ago after training at all the commercial chain
          gyms in the area and a few others, with all of them failing to impress. I knew Prime was the right place for
          me on day 1. Friendly welcoming atmosphere with everyone stopping to say hello and offer advice and
          encouragement if needed. Brilliant staff and range of equipment. <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></p>
        <p><i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> The best gym whether you are a beginner or advanced , the knowledge and
          the people who train here are first class ! Staff always helpful and knowledgable , makes me wonder why would
          you train anywhere else !
          Matt the owner has a wealth of knowledge and experience to get you to achieve your goals .. and more , your
          only barrier are the ones you put up yourself <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></p>
        <p><i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> A great gym recently refurbished with modern and classic equipment. Great
          atmosphere and training vibe with lots of motivated people! I liked the fact I could get a spot at any time
          and the help and advice from the friendly staff. Would recommend the place strongly as the place to go if you
          are serious about lifting or interested in learning how! <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></p>
